# Pathogenic Variants in all of us

Using the ACMG SF v3.3 list of pathogenic variants we can use this repo to generate datsets in All Of Us.

Start by git cloning this repo to AllOfUs. Then just running scripts from 0 sequentially will produce a combined vcf containing only pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants across medically relevant diseases from the ACMG SF v3.3 list across all srWGS samples in v8 dataset.

More information in Bogdan Lab getoutline under Secondary Findings in All Of Us.
